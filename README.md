# GeoTagging_App
Develop a mobile application for recording and playing geotagged videos. Unlike photos in which geotag data is of a single point and orientation pair, for videos geotag data is a sequence of point and orientation pairs. The mobile application should have two views. In one view the recorded video should play while simultaneously plotting field-of-view (orientation) cone and marker on an interactive map in the other view in a synchronized manner. The position shown on the map should match the play position of the video.
